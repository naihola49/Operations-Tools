# Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Analysis Tool

Interactive analysis tool for Economic Order Quantity models, helping optimize batch sizes by balancing setup costs and holding costs.

**Key Trade-off**: High setup costs (time for lost capacity) justify high batches, but may incur large holding costs, increased inventory, and longer cycle times. However, small batch sizes can be detrimental to capacity/lost throughput with repetitive setup times interrupting flow. The EOQ model strikes a balance between the two. However, business needs may justify larger batch sizes (offered discount + safety stock).
